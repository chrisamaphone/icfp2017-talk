Talking to computers:
Towards human-computer interactions that support compositional reasoning
Towards reasonable human-computer interactions

Abstract:

Interactions between human users and the complex emergent behavior of
algorithmic systems are an integral part of computing and an increasingly
pervasive part of life. 

Rather than treating algorithmic systems as proprietary black-boxes,
unknowable to the user, I argue for generative systems that support
transparent, calculable reasoning over their behavior. 

Programming languages have traditionally been considered only the language
spoken between programmer and machine, rather than between *user* and
machine.

But increasingly the distinctions between programmer and user are blurred,
and more skills in forming mental models about computational systems are
required to navigate ordinary lives.

We present applications of linear logic, dependent type theory, and
automated reasoning in the construction of virtual agents and environments.
